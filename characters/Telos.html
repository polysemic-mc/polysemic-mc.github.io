        <p style="text-align: center;">
          The 'Aheral wears glasses, not perfectly made to fit for him, being
          just slightly oversized. He has no visible scars, although his left
          eye seems to be just slightly off-coloured. The clothes he wears are
          rather simple, and he holds a mostly carefree attitude, his figure
          composed at most times. He can often be found watching people pass by
          busy streets.
